## Requirements

Each vocabulary in this repository is described by three files: the `*.xml` source file, an auto-generated equivalent `*.json` representation, and a `*.md` Markdown description, also auto-generated from the `*.xml` source.

No specific tools are needed to use these vocabulary files.

Contributors to this repository will need to run the generators, which require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed.

## Download and Installation

The tools in this repository are only needed by contributors to refresh the `*.json` and `*.md` files after changing the `*.xml` source files. These tools require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed.

### Installation

Clone or download this repository, go to its root folder, and type

```sh
npm install
```

### Editing

Edit only the XML files, then refresh the JSON and Markdown files with

```sh
npm run build
```
