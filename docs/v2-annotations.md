# SAP Annotations for OData Version 2.0

## Introduction

OData services provide a uniform interface for interacting with their resources, and in addition are self-describing:

- The _service document_ (located at the service root) lists the available top-level resources, and
- The _service metadata document_ (located at the address `$metadata` relative to the service root) describes the structure of all resources in the service.

This structural metadata makes it easy to understand a service, and human-readable documentation can be directly embedded into the metadata document, helping developers consume an OData service.

This alone is a huge benefit, yet metadata can be taken one step further by embedding _machine-readable_ additional metadata that can be leveraged by development tools, client libraries, and generic clients to better interact with the service.

One area are _semantic annotations_ that tell which of the OData properties contain e.g. a phone number, a part of a name or address, or something related to a calendar event or an analytic query. This is important for apps running on mobile devices that want to seamlessly integrate into contacts, calendar, and telephony.

The next area are _capability annotations_ that describe which of the possible interactions defined by OData's uniform interface are supported by which parts of a concrete service. These annotations will e.g. tell whether an entity set allows inserts, updates, or deletes, whether it requires a filter, and which properties can be used in filter expressions. They also advertise capabilities that go beyond the base set defined by OData, e.g. whether an entity set allows [free-text search via an SAP-defined query option](#query-option-search).

## AtomPub Service Document

[AtomPub](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5023) allows extending the service document with elements and attributes from XML namespaces other than AtomPub. The following sections describe which elements of the service document (namespace [`https://www.w3.org/2007/app`](https://www.w3.org/2007/app), namespace prefix `app`) can be annotated with attributes and elements from the namespace `http://www.sap.com/Protocols/SAPData` (namespace prefix `sap`) and from the namespace [`http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom`](http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom) (namespace prefix `atom`), and what these annotations mean.

### Element `app:service`

The `app:service` element can be annotated with two elements from the `atom` namespace:

- `<atom:link rel="self" href="..."/>` contains the link to this service document, and
- `<atom:link rel="latest-version" href="..."/>` contains the link to latest version of this service.

If the latest-version link deviates from the self link, a client may inspect the newer version of the service and decide (probably after asking its user) to switch over to the newer service version.

### Element `app:collection`

The `app:collection` element can be annotated with three elements:

- `<sap:member-title>` contains the human-readable name or caption for a single member of the collection. This typically is the singular form of the content of the `<atom:title>` element of this collection.
- `<atom:link rel="search" href="..."/>` contains the link to an [OpenSearch description document](http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#OpenSearch_description_document) that describes how to use free-text search for this collection. For those not familiar with OpenSearch: just append the [SAP-specific query option `search`](#query-option-search) to the URL of the collection.
- `<atom:link rel="http://www.sap.com/Protocols/SAPData/rel#subscribe" href="..."/>` contains the link to the collection of the same service that allows subscribing to content changes of the annotated collection. For more information see the [HowTo Guides - Subscription & Notification with SAP NetWeaver Gateway - Series](https://blogs.sap.com/2012/05/07/howto-guides-subscription-notification-with-sap-netweaver-gateway-series/).

It can also contain the attribute `sap:addressable` with the same value as for the corresponding entity set in the metadata document.

## Metadata Document

OData's [Conceptual Schema Definition Language (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd541474.aspx) allows annotating most model elements with XML attributes or elements from foreign XML namespaces. The following sections describe which elements of the metadata document (namespace prefix `edm`) can be annotated with attributes and elements from the namespace `http://www.sap.com/Protocols/SAPData` (namespace prefix `sap`), and what these annotations mean. For binary attributes the meaning is described for the value `true`.

### Element `edm:Schema`

Schemas can be annotated with the following attributes. If not stated explicitly, consumers can assume them to have the default value listed in the second column. This default value reflects the "normal" behavior.

| Attribute Name | Default Value | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Replaced by                                                                |
| :------------- | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| schema-version | 0000          | A non-negative number indicating the version of the schema. This can be considered a sub/minor version of the service version. It should be incremented whenever additive changes are made in a subsequent shipment of the same service version, and it can be used by clients to detect whether the service meets their minimal data provisioning needs. | [`Core.SchemaVersion`](../vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#SchemaVersion) |

### Element `edm:EntityContainer`

Entity containers can be annotated with the following attributes. If not stated explicitly, consumers can assume them to have the default value listed in the second column. This default value reflects the "normal" behavior.

| Attribute Name          | Default Value | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------------- | :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| message-scope-supported | false         | Service supports the request header `sap-message-scope`                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| supported-formats       | atom json     | A white-space separated list of format shortnames. Possible list items:<br/>• atom<br/>• json<br/>• xlsx<br/>The default is `sap:supported-formats="atom json"`.                                                                                |
| use-batch               | false         | Wrap all requests to resources of this service in batch requests; only the service document and the metadata document can be accessed unwrapped.This av oids exposing sensitive data in URLs (even with HTTPS URLs can be visible in log files) |

### Element `edm:EntitySet`

Entity sets can be annotated with the following attributes. If not stated explicitly, consumers can assume them to have the default value listed in the second column. This default value reflects the "normal" behavior that can be expected from any OData service.

| Attribute Name      | Default Value | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Must not be present if updatable-path is present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| updatable-path      | -             | Entities in this set can be updated or not depending on their state. The value of this attribute is a [path expression][path] that identifies a Boolean property in the context of the entity type of the entity set. The value of this property indicates whether the entity can be updated or not. Must not be present if updatable is present. See section below for details.                              |

| deletable-path      | -             | Entities in this set can be deleted or not depending on their state. The value of this attribute is a [path expression][path] that identifies a Boolean property in the context of the entity type of the entity set. The value of this property indicates whether the entity can be deleted or not. Must not be present if deletable is present. See section below for details.                              |

#### <a name="combined-meaning"></a>Combined meaning of `updatable` and `updatable-path`

The combined meaning of the annotations `updatable` and `updatable-path` is:

- If an entity set is neither annotated with `updatable` nor `updatable-path`, its entities can be updated
- If an entity set is annotated both with `updatable` and `updatable-path`, the service is broken and the client should assume that entities in this set cannot be updated
- If an entity set is annotated with `updatable=true`, its entities can be updated
- If an entity set is annotated with `updatable=false`, its entities cannot be updated
- If an entity set is annotated with `updatable-path`, its entities can be updated depending on the value of the Boolean property identified with this path expression:
  - If `updatable-path` points to a property that does not exist, the service is broken and the client should assume that the entity cannot be updated
  - If `updatable-path` points to a property that does not have the type Edm.Boolean, the service is broken and the client should assume that the entity cannot be updated
  - If `updatable-path` points to a property of type Edm.Boolean that exists, and this property has the value true, the entity can be updated
  - If `updatable-path` points to a property of type Edm.Boolean that exists, and this property has the value false, the entity cannot be updated
  - If `updatable-path` points to a property of type Edm.Boolean that exists, and this property has the value null, the service does not know whether the property can be updated. Semantically such a service is broken and the client should assume that the entity cannot be updated

The same rules apply to the combination of `deletable` and `deletable-path` on entity sets and the combination of `creatable` and `creatable-path` on navigation properties.

#### <a name="EntitySet-sapsemantics"></a>Attribute `sap:semantics`

This attribute can take the following values in the context of an entity type:

The descendant count of a node is the number of its descendants in the hierarchy structure of the result considering only those nodes matching any specified `$filter` and `$search`. The value of this attribute is always the name of another property in the same type. It points to the related property holding the hierarchy node ID. A property holding descendant counts has an integer data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| hierarchy-preorder-rank-for                 | -             | A property holding the preorder rank for a hierarchy node includes this attribute. The preorder rank of a node expresses its position in the sequence of nodes created from preorder traversal of the hierarchy structure after evaluating the `$filter` expression in the request excluding any conditions on key properties. The value of this attribute is always the name of another property in the same type. It points to the related property holding the hierarchy node ID. A property holding preorder ranks has an integer data type. The first node in preorder traversal has rank 0.                                                                                                                          |
| hierarchy-sibling-rank-for                  | -             | A property holding the sibling rank for a hierarchy node includes this attribute. The sibling rank of a node is the index of the node in the sequence of all nodes with the same parent created by preorder traversal of the hierarchy structure after evaluating the `$filter` expression in the request excluding any conditions on key properties. The value of this attribute is always the name of another property in the same type. It points to the related property holding the hierarchy node ID. A property holding sibling positions has an integer data type. The first sibling is at position 0.                                                                                                             |

#### Attributes `sap:unit` and `sap:precision`

Amounts in a currency or absolute measures MUST be represented as simple properties with an appropriate numeric Edm type, preferably `Edm.Decimal`. These numeric properties SHOULD refer to a string property containing the ISO currency or unit of measure with the `sap:unit` attribute. They MAY refer to a numeric property containing the (non-negative) number of decimal places to be used for displaying the amount or measure with the `sap:precision` attribute.

Example in metadata document:

```xml
<Property Name="OrderedQuantity" Type="Edm.Int16" sap:unit="OrderedUnit" />
<Property Name="OrderedUnit" Type="Edm.String" sap:semantics="unit-of-measure" />
<Property Name ="Price" Type ="Edm.Decimal" Precision="10" Scale ="3" sap:unit ="Currency" sap:precision="DisplayScale" />
<Property Name="DisplayScale" Type ="Edm.Byte" />
<Property Name="Currency" Type ="Edm.String" sap:semantics="currency-code" sap:text="CurrencyText" />
<Property Name="CurrencyText" Type="Edm.String" />
```

Example in Atom entry:

```xml
<d:OrderedQuantity>50</d:OrderedQuantity>
<d:OrderedUnit>KGM</d:OrderedUnit>
<d:Price>86.9</d:Price>
<d:DisplayScale>2</d:DisplayScale>
<d:Currency>EUR</d:Currency>
<d:CurrencyText>Euro</d:CurrencyText>
```

Using a reference attribute instead of predefined complex types like Measure or Money with amount and unit properties allows several amounts to share the same unit. Transporting the amounts as `raw` numeric values instead of preformatted strings allows clients to format them according to device-specific settings (that may well differ from the server-side user settings) or process them on the client (if e.g. the client is Excel).

#### Attribute `sap:field-control`

Whether a property can or must contain a value may depend on the state of its entity, so it is impossible to express this up-front via metadata annotations. In these cases the "edit state" of the property can be expressed via a separate "field control" property, and the link between data properties and their field-control properties is expressed with the `sap:field-control` attribute.

Example in metadata document:

```xml
<Property Name="Street" Type="Edm.String" sap:field-control="Address_fc" />
<Property Name="City" Type="Edm.String" sap:field-control="Address_fc" />
<Property Name="Address_fc" Type="Edm.Byte" />
```

The field-control property can be in the same type as shown above, or it can be in a nested complex type, or in an entity type that is associated 1:1. This allows separating field-control data from "real" data. If for example the field-control property is contained in a complex property or navigation property named `fc`, the attribute value is a path relative to the parent of the annotated property, e.g. `sap:field-control="fc/Address"`.

The possible values for a field-control property are:

| Value | Meaning                                                    |
| :---- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7     | Mandatory - property must contain a value                  |
| 3     | Optional - property may contain a null value               |
| 1     | Read-only - property cannot be changed                     |
| 0     | Hidden - property should not be visible on user interfaces |

#### <a name="Property-sapsemantics"></a>Attribute `sap:semantics`

The possible values in the context of a property are:

| Value              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| yearmonthday       | Calendar: year, month and day as string following the logical pattern (-?)YYYY(Y\*)MMDD consisting of an optional minus sign for years B.C. followed by at least eight digits, where the last four digits represent the months January to December (MM) and the day of the month (DD).

#### Attribute `sap:filter-restriction`

A property can be annotated with this attribute, if filter restrictions exist. The attribute can take the following values:

| Value        | Meaning                                                                                       |

| Value     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mandatory | A value must be supplied for this parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| optional  | A value for this parameter can be left out by specifying an empty string (applicable only for parameter properties of type Edm.String). For parameters of other types, the default value conveyed in the metadata should be assigned, if the parameter shall be omitted. |

#### Attribute `sap:preserve-flag-for`

A property holding the preservation state for another property includes this attribute.
The preservation state is a Boolean flag indicating whether or not the value of a named entity property is protected against updates causedby side-effects of updates to the entity set.
Example:
Consider an entity set holding order items with unit price, quantity, and total amount. All three properties supports preservation, as shown here for the unit price:

```xml
<Property Name="UnitPrice" Type="Edm.Decimal" />
<Property Name="UnitPricePreserveFlag" Type="Edm.Boolean" sap:preserve-flag-for="UnitPrice" />
```

For a given order item, a consumer can set the preservation flag for the total amount and update the unit price. This would instruct the provider to recalculate the quantity instead of the total amount.

                ReturnType="ThisModel.ApprovalResult"
                m:HttpMethod="POST"

A function import can optionally include an annotation with an `sap:value-constraint` element.

#### Element `sap:value-constraint`

This element describes a dependency of function import parameters to key properties of an entity set, comparable to a referential constraint.
Example: For a function import with two parameters for country and region, the possible arguments can be determined via some Regions entity set.

```xml
<sap:value-constraint set="Regions">
     <sap: parameter-ref name="Country" />
     <sap:parameter-ref name="Region" />
</sap:value-constraint>
```

It has a `set` attribute that identifies the entity set containing the list of allowed parameter value combinations.

Nested `sap:parameter-ref` elements link the function import parameters specified with the `name` attribute to a key property of the entity type of the specified entity set. The sequence of `sap:parameter-ref` elements matches the sequence of the `edm:PropertyRef` elements of the `Key` element.

## Instance Annotations

An annotation of an element in the OData metadata document adds information at the structural level of the service. Sometimes extra pieces of information are needed in the OData response for individual entities and their properties. To distinguish these two cases the former are called metadata annotations, while annotations of the entities in the OData response are called instance annotations.
Metadata annotations add information to the model structure. They are fully described by adding the appropriate AnnotationElement or AnnotationAttribute to a model element.
For instance annotations, this is different, because it must be possible to add different annotation values for every entity or every entity property, respectively. Therefore, if instance annotations are relevant for instances of some entity type, the structure of the entity type gets extended by properties specifically added for the purpose of holding annotation values in the result entities. These extra properties are also annotated with sap:is-annotation=`true` to identify them as
annotation holders and separate them from the other properties of the entity type.
A single entity can have multiple instance annotations, for each of which an extra property gets added to the underlying type:

- Zero or more for the entity itself.
- Zero or more for every property contained in the entity.

Properties representing instance annotations are always introduced by AnnotationAttributes in the metadata document. The following sections describe the possible occurrences.
Example:

```xml
<Property Name="Street" Type="Edm.String" Nullable="true" sap:field-control="Address_FC" />
<Property Name="City" Type="Edm.String" Nullable="true" sap:field-control="Address_FC" />
<Property Name="Address_FC" Type="Edm.Byte" Nullable="true" sap:is-annotation="true" />
```

## Query Option `search`

Modern user interfaces typically feature a search box for entering a free-text search term, and how exactly this search term is used to find "matching" things is up to the application. The custom query option `search` is intended exactly for passing such a free-text search term to the backend and let the backend decide against which properties of each entity in the entity set the term is matched, and how. It may also be matched against properties of related entities, e.g.

```http
GET /Orders?search=blue
```

to find all orders with items that refer to a blue product. Service implementations using SAP NetWeaver Gateway OData Channel will receive the search term in the parameter `IV_SEARCH_STRING` of method `GET_ENTITYSET`, see [SAP Gateway Foundation Developer Guide](https://help.sap.com/viewer/68bf513362174d54b58cddec28794093/201909.002/en-US/05fb2651c294256ee10000000a445394.html) for details.
Note that `search` works similar to `$filter`: it will return a subset of the entities that are returned when no search term is specified. And it combines with `$filter`, returning only entities that fulfill both conditions.

## Entity Set with Hierarchy

Entities can be organized in a tree if the underlying type contains additional properties allowing to determine the position of each entity in that tree. These are:

- A non-key property containing the node ID of the entity within the tree; this `node ID property` is annotated with `hierarchy-node-for`
- Either another non-key property containing the node ID of the parent entity within the tree; this property is annotated with `hierarchy-parent-node-for`
- Or a single-valued navigation property leading to the parent entity within the tree; this navigation property is annotated with `hierarchy-parent-navigation-for`

In addition, further useful hierarchy information can be added via properties annotated with `hierarchy-level-for`, `hierarchy-external-key-for`, `hierarchy-drill-state-for`, `hierarchy-node-descendant-count`, `hierarchy-preorder-rank-for`, and `hierarchy-sibling-rank-for`.

If a request against an entity set with annotated hierarchy addresses the node ID property of a hierarchy in `$select`, the provider should ensure that the query result is a well-formed partial tree of that hierarchy. This means that for every entity in the result its ancestors in the hierarchy are also part of the result; the result should not contain any dangling hierarchy nodes.

If the request includes a `$filter` expression with a condition testing equality of the node ID property with a specific node ID, the result is a sub-hierarchy whose root node is identified by the given node ID. The result can contain multiple sub-hierarchies if the `$filter` expression has multiple equality conditions for specific node IDs, combined with `or`. For a `$filter` expression with a parent filter condition testing the parent node ID property or the node ID property reached via the parent navigation property against a literal node ID, the result is the set of child nodes matching the condition.

A `$filter` expression is processed first to determine the set of matching entities, which is then enriched with additional node entities needed to complete all hierarchy paths as appropriate: from the matching entities up to the root node entity of a selected sub-hierarchy, or up to the root of the entire hierarchy, or in case of parent filter condition or an equality condition on the hierarchy level no further nodes are added to the result.

A result should contain the entities in pre-order for the selected sub-hierarchies, or for the entire hierarchy if not filtered to sub-hierarchies. The sort order of sibling node entities in the result can be controlled with `$orderby`.
