# Modelling a user interaction with annotations

Certain user interactions cannot be handled by one request, because they follow the pattern "user triggers, server offers, user chooses". For example, the action "exchange product in a sales order item" is triggered by the user on a sales order item, the server returns the item with an inlined collection of alternative products, from which the user must then choose, and the request is repeated with the chosen product.

In the "upgrade case", the server returns only one alternative product and lets the user confirm rather than choose. Both cases (exchange and upgrade) are supported by a service with [these metadata](UI.UserInteraction-sample.xml), let's look at an example of the exchange case where the user chooses.

## User triggers

The "exchange product" action is triggered by the user on a sales order item without specifying a parameter.

```
POST SalesOrderItems(...)/userinteraction.sample.ExchangeProduct HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

## Server offers

The server returns the item with an inlined collection of alternative products, from which the user must then choose.

```
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "Order": "A",
  "Item": "010",
  "Product": "Wheat flour",
  "_AlternativeProducts": [
    {"Product": "Rice", "UpsellNote": "Healthier"},
    {"Product": "Noodles", "UpsellNote": "Tastes better"}
  ]
}
```

Servers that cannot send a structured payload in a 4xx response may instead return an error message with a [`Common.callback`](../vocabularies/Common.md#callback) instance annotation.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": {
    "code": "UF0",
    "message": {
      "lang": "en",
      "value": "Missing parameter 'NewProduct'"
    },
    "@Common.callback": {
      "Order": "A",
      "Item": "010",
      "Product": "Wheat flour",
      "_AlternativeProducts": [
        {"Product": "Rice", "UpsellNote": "Healthier"},
        {"Product": "Noodles", "UpsellNote": "Tastes better"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Upon receiving either of these payloads, the client constructs a user dialog based on (a) the `UI.UserInteraction` annotation of the `_AlternativeProducts` navigation property and (b) the UI annotations of the `AlternativeProduct` entity type. The [type](../vocabularies/UI.md#UserInteractionChooseSingle) of the `UI.UserInteraction` annotation implies that this is a choice popup, not a confirmation prompt. The superscripted headings in the popup also come from the annotations.

> ### Please choose a product<sup>a</sup>
>
> |Alternative Product<sup>b</sup>|Why it's better to buy this<sup>b</sup>|
> |-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
> |Rice                           |Healthier                              |
> |Noodles                        |Tastes better                          |
>
> <kbd>OK</kbd> <kbd>Cancel</kbd>

## User chooses

After the user has chosen, the client repeats the request with the chosen product inserted according to the `UI.UserInteraction/Parameters`.

```
POST SalesOrderItems(...)/userinteraction.sample.ExchangeProduct HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{"NewProduct": "Rice"}
```

The status 409 in the first response implies that the first request made no changes on the server. As a consequence
* if the first request had been a POST on a collection, the second request would again be a POST (not a PATCH)
* no second request is made if the user has canceled the popup (no clean-up needed).
