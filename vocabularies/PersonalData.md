Terms for annotating Personal Data


## Definition

Personal Data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"). 

An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.

Personal data can only be processed under certain legal grounds, e.g. explicit consent of the data subject or a contractual obligation.

This vocabulary defines terms specific to the European [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en).

Terms for contact and address information are defined in the [Communication vocabulary](Communication.md#).
