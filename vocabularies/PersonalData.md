Terms for annotating Personal Data


## Definition

Personal Data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"). 

An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.

Personal data can only be processed under certain legal grounds, e.g. explicit consent of the data subject or a contractual obligation.

This vocabulary defines terms specific to the European [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en).

Terms for contact and address information are defined in the [Communication vocabulary](Communication.md#).

Primary meaning of the data contained in the annotated entity set

Allowed Value|Description
:------------|:----------
[DataSubject](PersonalData.xml#L80)|Entities describing a data subject (an identified or identifiable natural person), e.g. customer, vendor, employee<br>These entities are relevant for audit logging. There are no restrictions on their structure. The properties should be annotated suitably with [FieldSemantics](#FieldSemantics).
[DataSubjectDetails](PersonalData.xml#L89)|Entities containing details to a data subject (an identified or identifiable natural person) but not representing data subjects by themselves, e.g. street addresses, email addresses, phone numbers<br>These entities are relevant for audit logging.

<a name="FieldSemanticsType"></a>
## [FieldSemanticsType](PersonalData.xml#L115)
**Type:** String

Primary meaning of a data field

Allowed Value|Description
:------------|:----------
[DataSubjectID](PersonalData.xml#L119)|The unique identifier for a data subject
[DataSubjectIDType](PersonalData.xml#L123) *([Experimental](Common.md#Experimental))*|The type of ID identifying the data subject and which is allocated when creating a consent record, e.g. an e-mail address or a phone number.
[ConsentID](PersonalData.xml#L128) *([Experimental](Common.md#Experimental))*|The unique identifier for a consent<br>A consent is the action of the data subject confirming that the usage of his or her personal data shall be allowed for a given purpose. A consent functionality allows the storage of a consent record in relation to a specific purpose and shows if a data subject has granted, withdrawn, or denied consent.
[PurposeID](PersonalData.xml#L140) *([Experimental](Common.md#Experimental))*|The unique identifier for the purpose of a processing of personal data<br>Any processing of personal data is based on specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and data are not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. The purposes are defined by the data controller or joint data controllers.
[ContractRelatedID](PersonalData.xml#L149)|The unique identifier for transactional data that is related to a contract that requires processing of personal data<br>Examples:<br> - Sales Contract ID<br> - Purchase Contract ID<br> - Service Contract ID
[LegalEntityID](PersonalData.xml#L163) *(Deprecated)*|Deprecated in favor of [`DataControllerID`](#DataControllerID)
[UserID](PersonalData.xml#L178) *([Experimental](Common.md#Experimental))*|The unique identifier of a user<br>A user is an individual who interacts with the services supplied by a system.
[EndOfBusinessDate](PersonalData.xml#L186) *([Experimental](Common.md#Experimental))*|Defines the end of active business and the start of residence time and retention period<br>End of business is the point in time when the processing of a set of personal data is no longer required for the active business, for example, when a contract is fulfilled. After this has been reached and a customer-defined residence period has passed, the data is blocked and can only be accessed by users with special authorizations (for example, tax auditors). All fields of type `Edm.Date` or `Edm.DateTimeOffset` on which the end of business determination depends should be annotated.
[DataControllerID](PersonalData.xml#L197) *([Experimental](Common.md#Experimental))*|The unique identifier of a data controller<br>The unique identifier of a legal entity which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The Data Controller is fully responsible (and accountable) that data protection and privacy principles (such as purpose limitation or data minimization), defined in the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or any other data protection legislation, are adhered to when processing personal data. The DataControllerID succeeds the LegalEntityID.
[BlockingDate](PersonalData.xml#L206) *([Experimental](Common.md#Experimental))*|Defines a date that marks when the provider of the data will block these<br>Defines a date that marks when the provider of the data will block these. This is the point in time when the processing of a set of personal data is no longer required for the active business, for example, when a contract is fulfilled. After it has been reached, the data is blocked in the source and can only be displayed by users with special authorizations (for example, tax auditors); however, it is not allowed to create/change/copy/follow-up blocked data. Consumers of the data should consider if there is an additional purpose to process the data beyond the defined blocking date.
[EndOfRetentionDate](PersonalData.xml#L214) *([Experimental](Common.md#Experimental))*|Defines the date when the provider destroys the data<br>Defines a date that marks when the provider of the data can destroy these. Consumers of the data should consider if there is an additional purpose (or a legal hold) to process the data beyond the defined destruction date.
