When a client application creates an entity instance, it could be created in the \"DraftOrders\" entity set. A subsequent offline entity\n            upload operation should omit the uploading of any local draft entities. The DataService.activateDraft API can be used to transition a draft entity\n            (and optionally its children) into non-draft entities so they will then become uploadable."
