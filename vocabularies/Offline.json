However OData permits having multiple entity sets sharing the same entity type.\nThis can be taken advantage of to enable a facility for local (offline) drafts by defining an additional local draft entity set corresponding to an existing backend-defined entity set.\nFor example, with a server-side entity set `Orders` and entity type `Order`, an additional `DraftOrders` entity set could be defined, marked with a `ClientOnly` annotation using the `LocalDraft` term type.\nThe annotation value is the name of the non-draft entity set using the same entity type.\nWhen a client application creates an entity instance, it could be created locally in the `DraftOrders` entity set. \nA subsequent offline entity upload operation will not upload any local draft entities.\nDraft entities and their children need to be transitioned into non-draft entities to become uploadable.\n          ",
