When a client application creates an entity instance, it could be created in the \"DraftOrders\" entity set. A subsequent offline entity\n            upload operation will not upload any local draft entities.\n            Draft entities and their children need to be transitioned into non-draft entities to become uploadable.\n            The linked non-draft entity set using the same entity type can be defined in the string value, and the implicit default value of null indicates that the draft set is linked with the only other non-draft entity set using the same entity type."
